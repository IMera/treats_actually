<p class="emph">When and where?</p><br>

<p>In the comfort of your own home at a time most convenient to you!<br><br>
So as to offer you the most relaxed, comfortable, beneficial and nourishing experience I run mobile Reiki or Reiki and Personal Coaching sessions, meaning you don't need to face any traffic or public transport to receive your dose of healing energy: I come to you.<br><br>
 Please get in touch via email, phone, or the contact form provided on the contact page, and we can have a chat about what you are looking for and agree on a time for our first Treat together. I am available for mornings, evenings and weekends to accommodate work schedules as well as more traditional daytime appointments. A typical Reiki only Treat lasts an hour; a combined Reiki and Personal Coaching Treat 1.5-2 hours.</p><br><br>

<p class="emph">What happens?</p>
<p>Tangible magic! Or so it feels... :)<br><br>
To start off we have a brief chat and you get the opportunity to fill in a treatment form. The actual Reiki treatment happens with you either sitting or lying down, fully clothed as you are, in an armchair, on a couch or a bed. I use my hands to feel and move energy flowing through your body, this can be done with or without touch. Note that Reiki is not a massage and I mostly work hands-off. <br><br>
Some people feel more of the 'stuff going on' than others; whether you feel the energy or not you will certainly have a relaxing enjoyable experience. To close we will have another brief chat about our experiences and anything that may have come up. You can expect to feel the effects of our session together in the days and weeks following your Treat, during which time you are also welcome to get in touch should you want to ask any questions or talk anything over.<br><br>
If you chose to Treat yourself to both Reiki and Personal Coaching, we will segue into the coaching session after the Reiki treatment. Coaching happens in the form of a guided conversation where I use question techniques, listening techniques and if needed some exercises to enable you to achieve clarity around the topic you chose for us to address.</p>
