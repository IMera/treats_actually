<p class="emph">The Concept and Science behind Energy Healing</p>
<p>Like the more well-known practice of acupuncture, Reiki is based on the Eastern teaching that a healthy body, spirit and mind require energy to flow freely throughout the body. This energy is made up of Universal energy (Rei) and the life energy found in any living thing (Ki).  Indeed, modern physics has come to appreciate that at the smallest scale, we are not matter but indeed energy. Scientific investigation has also shown that for instance strong negative emotions change an individual's energy field. These results sit well with the belief held in the Eastern traditions that blockages in the energy flow equate with ill-health. Reiki works to release the blockages and restore energetic balance.<br><br>
See <a href="http://www.thehealingco.com/science_of_energy_healing.htm">http://www.thehealingco.com/science_of_energy_healing.htm</a> to read more on the scientific underpinnings of energy healing.</p>
<br>

<p class="emph">Varieties of Reiki</p>
<p>There are many different forms of energy healing and of Reiki; the form of Reiki I practice is the one most true to the original Japanese teaching and called Usui Reiki Ryoho. This form of Reiki was conceived as an active healing method so beyond providing relaxation it can also treat specific issues in a targeted manner.<br><br>
More specifically, Reiki can be practiced to two main ends:<br>
 Firstly, to (passively) facilitate gradual self-healing and balancing of the body. This is done by acting as a channel for Universal energy to flow into the body.<br>
  Secondly it can be practiced to achieve more focused healing in addition to the general balancing. This is done by directing and affecting energy: Rather than channelling energy with no input into the energy frequency or amplitude I actively work on the energy. This way, specific issues and conditions can be effectively worked on and treated in addition to the facilitation of overall relaxation and wellbeing: It has been demonstrated scientifically that various body parts and functions operate at certain frequencies as they work on electromagnetic signals, so a condition can be counteracted by inducing the appropriate energy frequency.</p>

<p class="emph">Is it for you?</p>
<p>Reiki can alleviate stress, heal past and present emotional traumas, and most physical conditions. Receiving Reiki is by most described as a relaxing, rejuvenating, nourishing experience. </p>
<p class="emph">Whether you are just looking to look after yourself a little - i.e. enjoy a well-deserved EnergyTreat  -  or heal a specific ailment - i.e.  experience HEALINGactually - feel free to get in touch and ask questions!</p>
<p>Examples of ill-health which Reiki has effectively healed are sports injuries, back pain, muscle damage, broken bones, allergies, addictions, nerve damage, arthritis, depression. Of course I will always make sure to take your medical condition into account, if you have one, and implications of any medications you may be taking; and only treat you after prior discussion with your doctor if needed.<br><br> 
If you are on the fence about it- why not give it a go? You only have everything to win. :) </p>
