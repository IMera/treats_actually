<p class="emph">The Concept and Science behind Energy Healing</p>
<p>Like the more well-known practice of acupuncture, Reiki is based on the Eastern teaching that a healthy body, spirit and mind require energy to flow freely throughout the body. This energy is made up of higher frequency energy (Rei) and lower frequency energy (Ki). Indeed, modern physics has come to appreciate that at the smallest scale, we are not matter but indeed energy. Scientific investigation has also shown that for instance strong negative emotions change an individual's energy field. These results sit well with the belief held in the Eastern traditions that blockages in the energy flow equate with ill-health. Reiki works to release the blockages, restore energetic balance and accelerate repair. It has been scientifically proven that energy healers produce an electromagnetic field, infrared energy and biophoton emissions from their hands when healing, which can often be felt as heat or tingling during a treatment.<br><br>
See <a href="http://www.thehealingco.com/science_of_energy_healing.htm" target='_blank'>http://www.thehealingco.com/science_of_energy_healing.htm</a> to read more on the scientific underpinnings of energy healing.</p>
<br>

<p class="emph">Varieties of Reiki</p>
<p>There are many different forms of energy healing and of Reiki; the form of Reiki I practice is the one most true to the original Japanese teaching and called Usui Reiki Ryoho. This form of Reiki was conceived as an active healing method so beyond providing relaxation it can also treat specific issues in a targeted manner.<br><br>
More specifically, Reiki can be practiced to two main ends:<br>
 Firstly, to (passively) facilitate gradual self-healing and balancing of the body. This is done by acting as a channel for Rei energy to flow into the body.<br>
  Secondly it can be practiced to achieve more focused healing in addition to the general balancing. This is done by directing and affecting energy: Rather than channelling energy with no input into the energy frequency or amplitude I actively work on the energy. This way, specific issues and conditions can be effectively worked on and treated in addition to the facilitation of overall relaxation and wellbeing: It has been demonstrated scientifically that various body parts and functions operate at certain frequencies as they work on electromagnetic signals, so a condition can be counteracted by inducing the appropriate energy frequency.</p>

<p class="emph">Is it for you?</p>
<p>Reiki can alleviate stress, heal past and present emotional traumas, and any physical conditions. Whilst receiving Reiki is by most described as a relaxing, rejuvenating, nourishing experience, your experience during the treatment itself depends on how sensitive you are to feeling energy flow. Reiki works regardless of what you feel; it is process-based and does not depend on any beliefs or convictions. It may help you to think of energy healing like gravity or the electricity waiting for you in its socket- you may not be able to see it, and there may have been a time when you didn't know it existed, or you may hold any wild belief about it. The ball will still fall and the lamp still light up.<br><br>
There are three possible outcomes of a Reiki treatment: Improvement of the condition, initial intensification of the symptoms followed by improvement, or no change.</p>
<p class="emph">Whether you are just looking to look after yourself a little - i.e. enjoy a well-deserved EnergyTreat  -  or heal a specific ailment - i.e.  experience HEALINGactually - feel free to get in touch and ask questions!</p>
<p>Examples of ill-health which Reiki has effectively healed are sports injuries, back pain, muscle damage, broken bones, allergies, addictions, nerve damage, arthritis, depression, and even cancer. Of course I will always make sure to take your medical condition into account, if you have one, and implications of any medications you may be taking; and only treat you after prior discussion with your doctor if needed.<br><br> 
If you are on the fence about it- why not give it a go? You only have everything to win. :) </p>
