<p class="emph">Tell me what you want, what you really really want...</p>
<p>One of my gifts is clarity.
I can share this gift with you and offer it to work at your service in a Personal Coaching Session.<br><br>
In my coaching sessions I ...<br><br>
... DO:</p>

<div class='row'>
  <div class='col-md-6 col-md-offset-3'>
<p>
  <ul class="nicelist">
  <li>help you find the answers you didn't know you knew</li>
  <li>help you gain clarity about your current situation and goals</li>
  <li>help you work out how to achieve your goals quickly and efficiently</li>
  <li>allow you to identify the strategies that work best for you</li>
  <li>actively empower you to move forward</li>
  <li>enable you to find direction and define your purpose</li>
  <li>let you find your own best solution</li>
</p>
  </div>
</div>
<br>
<p>... DON'T:</p>

<div class='row'>
  <div class='col-md-6 col-md-offset-3'>
<p>
  <ul class="nicelist">
  <li>tell you what to do </li>
  <li>tell you what action to take</li>
  <li>tell you 'that this is the best way and you absolutely must do this'</li>
</p>
  </div>
</div>
<br>

<p class="emph">Is it for you?</p><br>
<p>Could you do with some insight around a certain topic? An idea of how to move forward or past this block you are experiencing? Motivation to take action? Some re-sorting and re-organizing of yourself? An understanding of what you actually want and where you want to be going? More clarity in fine details or the bigger picture?</p>
<p class="emph">Try coaching. Good coaching has a tendency to surprise with its potency and effectiveness as well as the satisfaction it provides.</p><br>

<p class="emph">How do I think I can help?</p><br>
<p>Which do you like better- store bought standard flavour or homemade nan's special recipe cake?
  <br><br>
I seem to fit into a category that is sometimes labelled 'high-achiever'. However, I am certainly not a 'know-it-all' - to the contrary, I know rather little compared to some. Instead of knowing incredibly much, my gift lies in my ability to think well (and maybe a little differently than most).
<br> I am good at perceiving, putting things together, using those whirring cogwheels up there, and applying. These characteristics allow me to be a great coach: I don't come at you with lots of strong ideas about what's best, but I am fully there with a working, perceptive machine, allowing you to fill in the correct values for all variables as they apply to you, and helping you make sense of the equations and getting results.<br><br>
So what was that about the cake? Well, you can think of our coaching sessions like the really good yum homemade cake in your favourite flavour! 
<br>You won't get any ready cakes here. You may have met with the 'This is exactly the way to do it, go eat your cake' kind of help before. Despite the fact that there are only so many flavours they sell in supermarkets and your individual situation really can't be reduced down to just Strawberry or Mocca! <br>
No, in a coaching session with me, you have to do some work. You have to think, make decisions, break eggs, mix ingredients and shove it all in the oven. The crucial element is that you get to do so in a first rate kitchen with fabulous tools, recipe collections and counter tops. So that the cake coming out of it all is definitely to your taste and exactly what your palate requires, whether gluten free, pineapple or please god only fridge cake!
