<p class="emph">Qualifications</p>
<p>I am a qualified certified Reiki Healer (meeting the requirements of the National Occupational Standards (NOS) for Reiki and the Reiki Council Certificate of Professional Practice) and have received Personal Coaching Training from The Coaching Academy. <br><br>
  I also hold a Bachelor's degree in Psychology and Philosophy from Oxford University. <br><br>
  Furthermore, I am a trained Peer Supporter and have attained the Mental Health First Aid certificate; and am experienced in supporting people with struggles or mental ill-heath.<br><br>
Since I don't believe your qualifications define you... read on if you'd like to find out more about me other than an insight into some of the qualifications I hold!</p><br>

<p class="emph">And a bit more...</p>
<p>I grew up abroad, spending most of my pre-teen years on a sailing boat, in the ballet studio or far off in some world a book had taken me to. From the age of 13 onwards I lived in ballet boarding schools, before moving to the UK and joining a drama company after finishing the equivalent of A Levels. I then completed a BA at Oxford University.<br><br>
I have always felt a keen connection to nature and non-human life and a pull towards all things which in my environment were regarded as somewhat weird, mystical or esoteric. Following these interests, I experimented with energy in intuitive ways that felt right to me; as well as learning about energy, meditation, spirituality and personal growth from various of the big gurus out there. One of the pulls that I responded to had me flying to Hawaii and couchsurfing for a summer, where I then met and learned from wonderful people and a culture much wiser and more perceptive to 'the inivisible' than the Western one.<br><br>
Even though energy work started out as a private interest of mine, having gained the appropriate certificates, I wanted to make it possible for others to benefit from how I work with energy. Conveniently, as I am a working actress, my schedule is variable and flexible- enabling me to come see you at a time that works for you when I am not on set! Go and head on over to <a href="www.meramayde.com">www.meramayde.com</a> to find out more about what I do when I am not doing energy work or coaching!</p>
